    <h1>Conjunction Junction Function</h1>

    <p>I had the Conjunction Junction song stuck in my head and thought it'd be fun to make a function that outputs a random lyric from it.</p>

    <h2>Named Function</h2>
    <code>
        <pre>
            <strong>
            function(parameter){
                Do something();
            }
            </strong>

            function randomLyrics(lyrics) {
                const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * lyrics.length);
                return lyrics[randomIndex];
            }

            const songLyrics = [
                "Hooking up words and phrases and clauses",
                "Hooking up two boxcars and making 'em run right",
                "Hooking up two cars to one when you say something like this choice",
                "Hooking up phrases and clauses that balance",
                "Hooking up words and phrases and clauses in complex sentences",
                "Hooking up cars and making 'em function"];

            console.log(`Conjunction Junction, what's your function? ${randomLyrics(songLyrics)}`);
        </pre>
    </code>

    <h2>Function Expression</h2>
    <code>
        <pre>

                Do something();
            }
            </strong>

            const randomLyrics = function(lyrics) {
                const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * lyrics.length);
                return lyrics[randomIndex];
            }

            const songLyrics = [

                "Hooking up cars and making 'em function"];

            console.log(`Conjunction Junction, what's your function? ${randomLyrics(songLyrics)}`);
        </pre>
    </code>

    <h2>Arrow Function</h2>

            <strong>
            const aVariable = arrow function...{
