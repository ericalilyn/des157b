        <p>I learned that the QR code needs to be placed strategically so bicyclists who come upon it have an area to park their bike and be able to scan the code without obstructing the bike path area. Changes that would help with this is choosing the area of the Davis Bike Loop that has a rest area nearby so that users can make a quick stop there to participate in the project. Another addition would be to make sure users know to not be in the way of bicyclists on the path so no accidents happen while they are on their phones interacting with the project.</p>
