        <p class="padding">I learned that the prototype makes sense going through the main features for each location. The overall flow of a new user who is on site makes sense, and the site navigation is still effective for returning users to access any of the pages for each location. Some changes I would make are adding an interactive map as the landing page, and there would be pins for each location that lead to the respective pages when clicked.</p>
