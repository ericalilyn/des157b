    <h1>Project Proposal</h1>
    
    <div class="text-container border padding">
        <p>My topic of choice is the Davis Bike Loop, especially some key areas of interest along the route. The target audience is new residents of the Davis area who will use the bike paths and encounter these locations. This audience might include new UC Davis students/faculty who have just moved here or anyone who has been here for a while but are still not familiar with the area. At this time, I do not plan to work with a partner, but I would be willing to collaborate with someone if our topics aligned.</p>
        <p>Some of the features I imagine my project would include are photos of specific locations or landmarks that one can see by traveling via the Davis Bike Loop. To complement the visuals, there would also be captions and sections of text. These elements would offer more detail into the historical context of the locations shown. The goal would be to answer any potential questions a passerby would have about a location, and specifically if it was the first time they had ever been there. Another feature would be to have users upload their own photos of the bike route into a community gallery.</p>
        <p>Possible concerns related to my ideas are that I do not know the Davis Bike Loop route well enough myself to make sure all the notable areas and histories of it are accounted for. I anticipate a lot of research will need to be done so I feel like I need to scale down the focus to a specific part of the route. In particular, there are some locations that are closer to campus that could be worth highlighting for UC Davis students. A challenge for myself would be to make this a responsive mobile interface so it is more accessible and usable for people at the location.</p>
