        <h4>Significant Observations</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>The user expects the map icon button for the main page to redirect them back to the map interface. Instead, they keep having to sign in and think it is an error.</li>
            <li>The user expects the map marker popups to be clickable and link to the respective locations.</li>
            <li>The user notices that the location name heading is briefly hidden when going between location pages, and finds that a reset scroll feature would help fix it.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h4>Updates Based on Feedback</h4>
        <p>I plan to update my capstone project so there is a more intuitive user flow between screens and when going through the loop of unlocking locations. This includes adding in an alternative method to link to each location page in the map popups so it is more obvious as to which locations are able to be accessed, as well as a reset scroll feature so users do not get confused about the layout of the content.</p>
