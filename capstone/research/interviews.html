            <h4>Interviewees</h4>
            <p>Cindy T. (rides the bike traveling around the UC Davis campus and student housing areas)
               <br>
               Amy M. (walks everywhere on the UC Davis campus and downtown Davis and occasionally on bike paths)

            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>From the target audience interviews, I learned that for people living near campus and downtown, there are many places of interest on the Davis Bike Loop that they would like to know more about. This includes the overpass connecting West Village to the rest of the campus and the tunnel under La Rue Road which had flooded during the heavy rain season.</p> 
            <p>Additionally, the interviewees specified that they are more familiar with locations that are relatively close to the main campus. I have come to the conclusion that it is reasonable to focus on areas that are more accessible to students and locals who know how to navigate the campus/downtown area of Davis. With that in mind, my capstone project can take on a larger target area and still be centered around similar aspects of Davis history and culture.</p> 
            <p>I also found out that there is a shared sentiment for wanting to learn more about the biking history in Davis. There is the common knowledge of how accessible the city is for biking but people often do not know the full story of how it came to be. Having a location which provides this information in a fun and engaging manner could be a memorable experience for people who want to know more.</p>
