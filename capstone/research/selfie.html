    <h1>Selfie Seal</h1>

    <div id="container">
        <img id="image" src="images/selfie-seal.jpg" alt="Selfie taken with the seal">
        <p>The aspects of the seal that interest me the most are the Davis Bike Loop and the Davis Food Co-op. The panel with the different bikes and the symbol of the wheel in the entire seal design caught my eye when I visited. I also recently learned about the Davis Food Co-op and its history, which matches with the ideas represented by the seal.</p>
