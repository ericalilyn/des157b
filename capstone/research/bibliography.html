"Mobile Learning in History Education." <em>Journal of Educational Media, Memory & Society</em>, Vol. 6, No. 1, Berghahn Books, 2014, pp. 107-123. <em>JSTOR, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/43049676">www.jstor.org/stable/43049676</a>.

        <p>The main focus is on the different methods of using mobile devices in learning about and interacting with one's surroundings. It is useful to my project in that it offers a basis for a largely mobile centered design in the form of using a device which a person can carry on their person while on the go. The point about interactivity in the sense of creating and sharing content online is relevant as well, since my project has a social media related feature. The authors conclude that mobile devices as a medium for mobile learning marks a shift in how history can be analyzed and discussed, which supports a more interactive and participatory mindset to history education. My conclusion is that it gives a broader perspective on the mode of user centered and environmental learning.</p>

        <p>The purpose is to promote better understanding of a particular area and its features. In the case of this source, it is to create an online guide for viewing an arboretum, but nonetheless, it follows the same idea of how an educational tour of a connected environment is best designed. The figures provided are especially useful for how to display the physical QR code objects for my project and integrating the ideas of finding the locations of particular objects. The authors conclude that the easy accessibility of both mobile devices and the benefits of real encounters with the subjects that are being referenced offers an effective means for people to gain knowledge and literacy of the world around them. My conclusion is that it serves well as a self serving and readily available resource for the community to learn and engage with their environment.</p>

        <p>The main focus is to highlight the significance of public participation in fostering a connection to community and a sense of wellbeing. This source covers ideas related to active intent of participation, which is useful to my project which is largely centered around users being motivated to learn about Davis history and contribute to it. Additionally, it maintains that participation creates a sense of being a part of something which can improve feelings of belonging to a community. The author concludes that designing for collective engagement in situated places can increase public participation on shared perceptions and attitudes. My conclusions are that with the global connectedness that the internet offers, interactive projects like mine that are based around a particular community can be most effective if it offers a space for people to contribute back to it.</p>
